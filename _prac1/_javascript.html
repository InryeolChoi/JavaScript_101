    <h2>Javascript</h2>
    <p>JavaScript, often abbreviated JS, 
        is a programming language that is one of the core technologies
        of the World Wide Web, alongside HTML and CSS.
        Over 97% of websites use JavaScript on the client side for web page behavior,
        often incorporating third-party libraries. 
        All major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute the code on users' devices.
        JavaScript is a high-level, often just-in-time compiled language 
        that conforms to the ECMAScript standard.
        It has dynamic typing, prototype-based object-orientation, and first-class functions.
        It is multi-paradigm, supporting event-driven, functional, and imperative programming styles.
        It has application programming interfaces (APIs) for working with text, dates, 
        regular expressions, standard data structures, and the Document Object Model.
